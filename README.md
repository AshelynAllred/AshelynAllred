## Welcome to my HitHub!
### Here's a bit about me:

My name is Ashelyn! (I'll let you guess what my last name is)

My day job requires me to frequently write scripts with a modified program-specific Visual Basic (Cabinet Vision), and the occasional powershell/batch file. 
I really enjoy frontend development and spend a lot of time making things look pretty. In the past, I've contributed to developments written in C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python, 
mostly mods for games I enjoy playing, standalone game developments (e.g., in Godot or Unity), or just neat little tools to make my day to day easier.

Most of my work is either lost to time, not in a repo, or on accounts I'd rather not share right now. Feel free to ask me about the projects though!

If you'd like a CSS/web dev example of my work, I recently reworked a Shopify frontend for The Daily Grind TCG's website. (update: website is currently down due to matters between the business and shopify, but I have screenshots of the website available as a project on my LinkedIn page. Sorry about that)

I'm currently taking a course on Data Analytics, which I hope to be able to use to make cool graphs or something for companies that pay for that sort of thing.
If you've got any good portfolio-building projects you could use a helping hand on, definitely reach out!
Speaking of, the best way to get ahold of me would be via email ("ashelyn.allred@ _ gmail. _ com" with the spaces and underscores removed. The email is formatted this way to hopefully prevent inbox spam from web scrapers.)

Thank you!
