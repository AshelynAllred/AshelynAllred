## Welcome to my HitHub!
### Here's a bit about me:

My name is Ashelyn! (I'll let you guess what my last name is)

My day job requires me to frequently write scripts with a modified program-specific Visual Basic (Cabinet Vision), and the occasiona powershell/batch file. 
I really enjoy frontend development and spend a lot of time making things look pretty. In the past, I've contributed to developments written in C#, Java, JavaScript, and Python, 
mostly mods for games I enjoy playing, standalone game developments (e.g., in Godot or Unity), or just neat little tools to make my day to day easier.

Most of my work is either lost to time, not in a repo, or on accounts I'd rather not share right now. Feel free to ask me about the projects though!
If you'd like a CSS/web dev example of my work, I recently put together the frontend for The Daily Grind TCG's website. [Check it out](https://www.thedailygrindtcg.com)!

I'm currently taking a course on Data Analytics, which I hope to be able to use to make cool graphs or something for companies that pay for that sort of thing.

Right now, I'd really like to collaborate with others on projects that would help get a decent portfolio put together. Don't heasitate to reach out!
Speaking of, the best way to get ahold of me would be via email ("ashelyn.allred@ _ gmail. _ com" with the spaces and underscores removed. The email is formatted this way to hopefully prevent inbox spam from web scrapers.)

Thank you!
